# SheAlerts
Project for SheInnovates 2019

She Alerts is a piece of wearable hardware that tracks your heart rate and includes a tilt sensor and LED. If She Alerts detects a high heart rate and the tilt sensor goes off, it prompts the LED. She Alerts waits for a few seconds and if a button is not pressed indicating that the wearer is alright then She Alerts sends an email to a doctor and family member.
